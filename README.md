We have an application that stores popular movies and categories in a data repository managed with Redux.

The Home Page is structured similarly to Netflix's homepage, providing users with quick access to popular movies and categories. The most popular films are displayed at the top.

The Movie Details page is where users are directed when they click on a popular movie. This page typically includes details such as the movie title, description, and rating.

Additionally, the Movie List by Genre offers a curated list to help users easily find films within specific genres.
